The dictionary.pyw file produces a Tkinter GUI that queries the Miriam Webster Dictionary API with a search word and returns the definition.

The word-definition pairs can be saved in a CSV file with the click of a button, allowing easy import into flashcard programs such as Anki (the program I am most familiar with).

This was built to address the minor hassle of copying and pasting words and their definitions into spreadsheets or flashcards. In all likelihood, similar (and better) functionality already exists, hence the initial courtesy word in the accompanying dictionary.csv file.
